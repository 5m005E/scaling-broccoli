GENERAL DESC.:
This project consists of multiple helper classes and custom local packages to efficiently
organize all the code.

Packages include:
- triePackage   [INCLUDES] -> "Trie" and "Trie Node" helper classes
- statsPackage  [INCLUDES] -> "Hasher" and "Predictive Engine" helper classes
======================
triePackage contains:
- Trie.java         <-  Organizes an array of characters into an efficient storage format.
- TrieNode.java     <-  Individual node in a trie.
----------------------
statsPackage contains:
- Hasher.java               <- Organizes data into hash maps for easy retrieval.
- PredictiveEngine.java     <- Assesses the best word guesses based on expected values.
